# DeepRead 

This project was born from one of my hobbies: **reading**.  I realized that I learned much better when I **summarized the books** I read, and even more when I later **tested my knowledge** with questions about them.  

That‚Äôs how **DeepRead** came to life ‚Äî a tool designed to make learning active, tracking progress through dashboards.

## Technologies Used
